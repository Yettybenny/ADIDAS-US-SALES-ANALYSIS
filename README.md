# ADIDAS-US-SALES-ANALYSIS

## Introduction

☄️Let me walk you through the unique processes I followed to gain insights for this project, which focuses on analyzing Adidas' US sales data using an interactive Power BI dashboard. 

## Objectives 

The goal was to provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance across product categories, regions, and time periods.

### Process Workflow 

A standout feature of the dashboard is the use of tooltips, which allow users to hover over specific data points and instantly access additional insights, enhancing understanding of sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance.

### Further Process

For this analysis, I utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to streamline calculations, categorized into three key sections:

  - Variance Calculations

  - Anchor Measures

  - Time Intelligence Measures

These sections simplified my computations, making it easier to derive meaningful insights. 

### Project Layout

I began by sketching my ideal layout and then created the format using PowerPoint, which I later imported into Power BI. 

Another features in this project was the integration of tooltips, which offer valuable insights when users hover over sales data points. 

These tooltips provide:

- Percentage changes in sales from the previous period.

- Product-specific sales growth or decline.

- Regional breakdowns, showing where sales are the strongest.
